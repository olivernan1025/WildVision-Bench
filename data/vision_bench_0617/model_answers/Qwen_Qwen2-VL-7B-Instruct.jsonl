The integral is set up as follows:\n\n\\[\n\\int_{-1/2}^{1/2} \\int_{-\\sqrt{y^2+1}}^{\\sqrt{y^2+1}} y \\, dx \\, dy\n\\]\n\nThis integral represents the double integral of the function \\( y \\) over the region defined by the limits of integration. The inner integral is with respect to \\( x \\), and the outer integral is with respect to \\( y \\). The limits of integration for \\( x \\) are from \\( -\\sqrt{y^2+1} \\) to \\( \\sqrt{y^2+1} \\), and the limits of integration for \\( y \\) are from \\( -1/2 \\) to \\( 1/2 \\).\n\nTo solve this integral, you would typically follow these steps:\n\n1. **Evaluate the inner integral** with respect to \\( x \\) first, treating \\( y \\) as a constant.\n2. **Evaluate the outer integral** with respect to \\( y \\) after substituting the result of the inner integral.\n\nLet's break it down:\n\n### Step 1: Evaluate the inner integral\nThe inner integral is:\n\\[\n\\int_{-\\sqrt{y^2+1}}^{\\sqrt{y^2+1}} y \\, dx\n\\]\nSince \\( y \\) is a constant with respect to \\( x \\), the integral of \\( y \\) with respect to \\( x \\) is simply \\( y \\) times the length of the interval, which is \\( 2\\sqrt{y^2+1} \\):\n\\[\n\\int_{-\\sqrt{y^2+1}}^{\\sqrt{y^2+1}} y \\, dx = y \\left[ x \\right]_{-\\sqrt{y^2+1}}^{\\sqrt{y^2+1}} = y \\left( \\sqrt{y^2+1} - (-\\sqrt{y^2+1}) \\right) = 2y\\sqrt{y^2+1}\n\\]\n\n### Step 2: Evaluate the outer integral\nNow, we have the outer integral:\n\\[\n\\int_{-1/2}^{1/2} 2y\\sqrt{y^2+1} \\, dy\n\\]\nTo solve this integral, you can use a substitution method. Let \\( u = y^2 + 1 \\), then \\( du = 2y \\, dy \\). The limits of integration for \\( u \\) are from \\( 1 \\) to \\( 1 \\) (since \\( y \\) goes from \\( -1/2 \\) to \\( 1/2 \\)):\n\\[\n\\int_{1}^{1} \\sqrt{u} \\, du = \\int_{1}^{1} u^{1/2} \\, du\n\\]\nThe integral of \\( u^{1/2} \\) is \\( \\frac{2}{3} u^{3/2} \\):\n\\[\n\\left. \\frac{2}{3} u^{3/2} \\right|_{1}^{1} = \\frac{2}{3} (1)^{3/2} - \\frac{2}{3} (1)^{3/2} = 0\n\\]\n\n### Conclusion\nThe value of the double integral is:\n\\[\n\\int_{-1/2}^{1/2} \\int_{-\\sqrt{y^2+1}}^{\\sqrt{y^2+1}} y \\, dx \\, dy = 0\n\\]\n\nThis result indicates that the area under the curve defined by the given function over the specified region is zero."}

The blanket had been a gift from his human, and it always brought a sense of security and comfort to Grumpy. As the night grew darker, Grumpy's eyes began to droop, and he drifted off to sleep, his grumpy face relaxed in peaceful slumber.\n\nIn his dreams, Grumpy found himself in a magical forest, where he met a group of friendly animals. They laughed and played, and Grumpy felt a warmth he hadn't felt in a long time. He realized that even though he was grumpy, he could still find joy in the simple things in life.\n\nWhen Grumpy woke up the next morning, he felt different. His grumpy expression had softened, and he approached his human with a newfound sense of contentment. From that day on, Grumpy's grumpiness began to fade, replaced by a gentle warmth and a love for the simple pleasures of life.\n\nAnd so, Grumpy's grumpy old days were behind him, and he lived the rest of his days in peace and happiness, surrounded by the love of his human and the warmth of his red blanket."}

Here's a breakdown of the key elements:\n\n1. **Blood Circulation**: The image shows a simplified representation of blood circulation, with a central blue area representing the bloodstream.\n\n2. **Spleen**: The spleen is depicted as a green boat-like structure in the bloodstream. The spleen is an organ responsible for filtering blood and removing old or damaged red blood cells (RBCs).\n\n3. **Antibody-Coated RBCs**: The image shows several red blood cells (RBCs) with red and white dots on them, indicating that they are coated with antibodies. This is a characteristic feature of AIHA, where the immune system mistakenly identifies RBCs as foreign and attacks them.\n\n4. **Hardworking Macrophages**: The image shows macrophages (a type of white blood cell) attacking the antibody-coated RBCs. Macrophages are responsible for engulfing and destroying damaged cells.\n\n5. **Autoimmune Hemolytic Anemia**: The title \"Autoimmune Hemolytic Anemia\" is placed at the top right, indicating the condition being explained. AIHA is a type of anemia where the immune system mistakenly destroys red blood cells, leading to a decrease in the number of RBCs in the bloodstream.\n\nThe image uses a cartoonish and simplified approach to explain the process of how AIHA occurs, focusing on the interaction between the spleen, macrophages, and antibody-coated RBCs."}

This equity is not just a reflection of the brand's tangible assets but also of its intangible attributes, such as its reputation, loyalty, and perceived value.\n\n### Significance of Customer-Based Brand Equity\n\n1. **Competitive Advantage**: A strong brand equity can provide a significant competitive advantage by allowing a company to command higher prices, attract more loyal customers, and withstand competitive pressures. Customers are more likely to remain loyal to a brand they trust and value.\n\n2. **Market Differentiation**: In crowded markets, customer-based brand equity helps businesses differentiate themselves from competitors. A well-established brand can create a unique identity that sets it apart from others, making it easier for customers to recognize and prefer it.\n\n3. **Customer Loyalty**: A strong brand equity fosters customer loyalty, which is crucial for long-term business success. Loyal customers are more likely to repurchase, recommend the brand to others, and engage with the brand in various ways, such as through social media and online reviews.\n\n4. **Brand Resilience**: In times of crisis or negative publicity, a strong brand equity can help a company weather the storm. Customers who have a positive association with a brand are more likely to remain loyal and support the brand during challenging times.\n\n### Strategies to Enhance Customer-Based Brand Equity\n\n1. **Quality Products and Services**: The foundation of any strong brand equity is the quality of the products or services offered. Consistently delivering high-quality offerings that meet or exceed customer expectations is crucial.\n\n2. **Customer Experience**: Providing an exceptional customer experience is another key strategy. This includes not only the products or services but also the interactions with customers, such as customer service, website usability, and overall brand communication.\n\n3. **Brand Consistency**: Maintaining a consistent brand image across all touchpoints is essential. This includes the brand's visual identity, messaging, and the overall customer experience. Consistency helps build trust and reinforces the brand's values and promises.\n\n4. **Customer Engagement**: Engaging with customers through various channels, such as social media, email marketing, and in-person events, can help build a stronger connection. Listening to customer feedback and responding to their needs and concerns can also enhance brand equity.\n\n5. **Brand Storytelling**: Telling a compelling brand story that resonates with customers can help build emotional connections. This can include the brand's history, values, and the impact it has on society.\n\n6. **Loyalty Programs**: Implementing effective loyalty programs can incentivize customers to remain loyal to the brand. These programs can include rewards, discounts, and exclusive offers that make customers feel valued.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nCustomer-based brand equity is a critical component of a successful marketing strategy. By understanding its importance and employing effective strategies to enhance it, businesses can build stronger relationships with their customers, differentiate themselves in the market, and ultimately achieve long-term success. As the world becomes increasingly competitive, the ability to create and maintain a strong brand equity will be essential for businesses to thrive."}

The chart is divided into two main sections: one for energy cost and one for area cost. Each section contains a table listing different operations along with their corresponding energy and area costs.\n\n### Energy Cost Section:\n- **Operation**: 8b Add\n  - **Energy (pJ)**: 0.03\n- **Operation**: 16b Add\n  - **Energy (pJ)**: 0.05\n- **Operation**: 32b Add\n  - **Energy (pJ)**: 0.1\n- **Operation**: 16b FP Add\n  - **Energy (pJ)**: 0.4\n- **Operation**: 32b FP Add\n  - **Energy (pJ)**: 0.9\n- **Operation**: 8b Mult\n  - **Energy (pJ)**: 0.2\n- **Operation**: 32b Mult\n  - **Energy (pJ)**: 3.1\n- **Operation**: 16b FP Mult\n  - **Energy (pJ)**: 1.1\n- **Operation**: 32b FP Mult\n  - **Energy (pJ)**: 3.7\n- **Operation**: 32b SRAM Read (8KB)\n  - **Energy (pJ)**: 5\n- **Operation**: 32b DRAM Read\n  - **Energy (pJ)**: 640\n\n### Area Cost Section:\n- **Operation**: 8b Add\n  - **Area (µm²)**: 36\n- **Operation**: 16b Add\n  - **Area (µm²)**: 67\n- **Operation**: 32b Add\n  - **Area (µm²)**: 137\n- **Operation**: 16b FP Add\n  - **Area (µm²)**: 1360\n- **Operation**: 32b FP Add\n  - **Area (µm²)**: 4184\n- **Operation**: 8b Mult\n  - **Area (µm²)**: 282\n- **Operation**: 32b Mult\n  - **Area (µm²)**: 3495\n- **Operation**: 16b FP Mult\n  - **Area (µm²)**: 1640\n- **Operation**: 32b FP Mult\n  - **Area (µm²)**: 7700\n- **Operation**: 32b SRAM Read (8KB)\n  - **Area (µm²)**: N/A\n- **Operation**: 32b DRAM Read\n  - **Area (µm²)**: N/A\n\n### Analysis:\n1. **Energy Cost**:\n   - The energy cost for operations increases with the number of bits involved. For example, the energy cost for an 8-bit add operation is 0.03 pJ, while for a 32-bit add operation, it is 0.1 pJ. Similarly, the energy cost for floating-point operations is higher than for integer operations. For instance, the energy cost for a 32-bit floating-point add operation is 0.9 pJ, which is significantly higher than the 0.1 pJ for a 32-bit integer add operation.\n\n2. **Area Cost**:\n   - The area cost also increases with the number of bits and the type of operation. For example, the area cost for an 8-bit add operation is 36 µm², while for a 32-bit add operation, it is 137 µm². Floating-point operations require significantly more area than integer operations. For instance, the area cost for a 32-bit floating-point add operation is 4184 µm², which is much higher than the 137 µm² for a 32-bit integer add operation.\n\n3. **Comparative Analysis**:\n   - The energy cost and area cost for memory read operations (SRAM and DRAM) are notably higher than for arithmetic operations. For example, the energy cost for a 32-bit DRAM read operation is 640 pJ, and the area cost is not provided but is likely to be very high due to the nature of DRAM technology.\n\n4. **Implications**:\n   - The chart highlights the trade-offs between energy efficiency and area efficiency in different operations. For applications where energy consumption is a critical factor, simpler operations like 8-bit arithmetic are preferred. However, for applications requiring higher precision and performance, more complex operations like floating-point arithmetic and memory reads are necessary, albeit at the cost of increased energy and area requirements.\n\nIn summary, the chart provides a clear comparison of the energy and area costs associated with various computational operations, emphasizing the trade-offs between different types of operations and their impact on system design."}

This figure illustrates a multimodal model architecture that combines visual and textual inputs to generate language outputs. Here's a detailed explanation of the components and their interactions:\n\n1. **Image Input**:\n   - The image input is processed by the **Vision Encoder**. This encoder converts the visual information from the image into a vector representation.\n\n2. **Language Instruction**:\n   - The language instruction is fed into the **Text Encoder**. This encoder converts the textual information into a vector representation.\n\n3. **Cross Modality Projector**:\n   - The outputs from the Vision Encoder and Text Encoder are fed into the **Cross Modality Projector**. This component projects the visual and textual representations into a common space, allowing them to be combined effectively.\n\n4. **Language Aligned Multimodal Embedding**:\n   - The combined representations from the Cross Modality Projector are further processed to create a **Language Aligned Multimodal Embedding**. This embedding is designed to align the visual and textual information in a way that is conducive to generating language outputs.\n\n5. **Large Language Model**:\n   - The Language Aligned Multimodal Embedding is then fed into a **Large Language Model**. This model is responsible for generating the final language output based on the combined visual and textual information.\n\n6. **LoRA (Low-Rank Adaptation)**:\n   - The Large Language Model is augmented with **LoRA** (Low-Rank Adaptation). LoRA is a technique that allows for efficient fine-tuning of large language models, enabling them to be adapted to specific tasks or domains without requiring extensive retraining.\n\n7. **Trainable and Frozen Components**:\n   - The figure also indicates that some components are trainable (indicated by the flame icon) and others are frozen (indicated by the snowflake icon). This distinction is important for understanding how the model is trained and how different parts of the model can be updated during training.\n\nIn summary, this multimodal model architecture combines visual and textual inputs through a series of encoders and projectors to create a language-aligned multimodal embedding. This embedding is then used by a large language model, which is further enhanced with LoRA for efficient fine-tuning.

{"question_id": "70ade5302f344e6f8a67bc5374c179cb", "instruction": "Describe this image.", "language": "English", "model": "Qwen/Qwen2-VL-7B-Instruct", "token_len": 572, "output": "The image appears to be a microscopic view of a tissue sample, likely stained with a method such as hematoxylin and eosin (H&E), which is commonly used in histology to highlight cellular structures. The tissue sample is composed of several layers, with the outermost layer showing a more densely packed arrangement of cells, while the inner layers appear more loosely organized.\n\nKey features observed in the image include:\n\n1. **Cellular Structures**: The image shows a variety of cells, some of which appear to be epithelial cells, characterized by their elongated shapes and the presence of nuclei. The nuclei are stained dark purple, indicating the presence of DNA.\n\n2. **Cell Arrangement**: The cells are arranged in a stratified manner, with the outermost layer showing a more compact and organized structure, while the inner layers appear more loosely packed. This stratification is typical of epithelial tissues, which are designed to protect underlying structures.\n\n3. **Staining**: The staining is consistent with H&E staining, where the nuclei are stained dark purple due to the hematoxylin dye, and the cytoplasm and extracellular matrix are stained pink to light purple due to the eosin dye.\n\n4. **Cell Details**: The nuclei are visible and appear round or oval, with distinct borders. Some cells show signs of cytoplasmic detail, although the resolution of the image does not allow for detailed identification of specific organelles.\n\n5. **Background**: The background is predominantly white, which is typical of histological slides, providing a neutral backdrop that enhances the visibility of the stained tissue.\n\n### Analysis and Description\n\nThis image is likely a histological section of an epithelial tissue, possibly from the skin or a mucosal lining. The stratified arrangement of cells suggests that this tissue is designed to protect against external factors, such as mechanical abrasion or chemical exposure. The presence of nuclei and the staining pattern are consistent with typical histological preparations, which are used to study the structure and function of tissues at a microscopic level.\n\n### Relevant Knowledge\n\nHistology is the study of the microscopic structure of tissues. H&E staining is a standard method used in histology to differentiate between various types of cells and tissues. The nuclei are stained dark blue-purple due to the binding of hematoxylin, while the cytoplasm and extracellular matrix are stained pink to light purple due to the binding of eosin. This staining method is crucial for identifying and classifying different types of cells and tissues, which is essential in medical diagnostics and research.\n\nIn summary, the image depicts a histological section of an epithelial tissue, likely stained with H&E, showing a stratified arrangement of cells with distinct nuclei and cytoplasmic details. This type of tissue is typically used for protective functions and is commonly studied in histology."}

The scene is dominated by a mix of modern and historic architecture, with a variety of buildings of different heights and styles scattered throughout the landscape.\n\nIn the foreground, there is a prominent red-domed building with a clock tower, which appears to be a significant landmark. This building is surrounded by lush greenery, including trees and well-maintained lawns, suggesting a park or a public square. The greenery provides a stark contrast to the urban environment, adding a touch of nature to the city.\n\nMoving further into the scene, the cityscape is characterized by a dense array of buildings. These buildings vary in height and design, with some featuring classical architectural elements such as domes and ornate facades, while others are more modern, with sleek, rectangular shapes. The buildings are tightly packed, indicating a high population density typical of urban areas.\n\nIn the middle ground, there is a wide avenue lined with trees, which serves as a central thoroughfare. This avenue appears to be a major road, with several vehicles visible, including buses and cars.

This suggests that there is a strong correlation between a country's economic prosperity (as measured by GDP per capita) and its electricity consumption per capita. In other words, as a country's income increases, so does its electricity consumption. This indicates that wealthier countries tend to use more electricity, likely due to higher energy-intensive activities and lifestyles."}

The decision boundary of logistic regression is a curve or surface that separates the data into two classes. In the case of binary logistic regression, the decision boundary is a straight line (in 2D) or a hyperplane (in higher dimensions). The decision boundary is determined by the coefficients of the logistic regression model and the input features. The model predicts the probability of the positive class, and the decision boundary is the point at which this probability is equal to 0.5."}

It consists of several key components and works as follows:\n\n### Circuit Components:\n1. **RF Input (RF_in)**: This is the input for the RF signal.\n2. **Bias Voltage (V_bias)**: Provides the necessary bias voltage for the transistors.\n3. **Transistors (M1, M2, M13, M14, M15)**: These are the main components of the power detector unit.\n4. **Op-Amp**: An operational amplifier (op-amp) is used to amplify the signal.\n5. **Exponential Current Generator**: Generates an exponential current based on the input signal.\n6. **Level Shifter**: Shifts the level of the output signal.\n\n### Working Principle:\n1. **RF Input (RF_in)**: The RF signal is applied to the input.\n2. **Bias Voltage (V_bias)**: The bias voltage is applied to the transistors to ensure they operate in the linear region.\n3. **Power Detector Unit**:\n   - Transistors M1 and M2 form a differential pair, which is a common configuration for power detection.\n   - The RF signal is applied to the gates of M1 and M2.\n   - The drain currents of M1 and M2 are proportional to the square of the RF signal amplitude.\n4. **Op-Amp**:\n   - The drain currents of M1 and M2 are fed into the op-amp.\n   - The op-amp compares the currents and outputs a voltage proportional to the difference between the currents.\n5. **Exponential Current Generator**:\n   - The output of the op-amp is used to drive the exponential current generator.\n   - The exponential current generator generates an exponential current based on the input signal.\n6. **Level Shifter**:\n   - The exponential current is then passed through the level shifter.\n   - The level shifter adjusts the level of the output signal to a suitable level for further processing or measurement.\n\n### Summary:\nThe circuit uses a differential pair to detect the power of the RF signal, amplifies the difference in currents using an op-amp, and then uses an exponential current generator to further process the signal. The level shifter ensures the output signal is at the correct level for the intended application. This architecture is designed to accurately measure the power of the RF signal in a linear and efficient manner."}

The objects are well-lit, and the scene appears to be indoors with natural light coming from a window.\n- **Depth Map**: The depth map shows a clear distinction between the foreground and background, with objects in the foreground appearing closer and objects in the background appearing farther away. The colors in the depth map are consistent with the objects' positions in the scene.\n\n### Image 2\n- **RGB Image**: This image also shows a table with various objects, similar to Image 1. The objects are well-lit, and the scene appears to be indoors with natural light.\n- **Depth Map**: The depth map is less clear compared to Image 1. The distinction between the foreground and background is not as sharp, and the colors in the depth map are less consistent with the objects' positions in the scene.\n\n### Image 3\n- **RGB Image**: This image shows a more complex scene with a table and various objects, including toys and a Rubik's cube. The scene appears to be indoors with artificial lighting.\n- **Depth Map**: The depth map is the least clear among the three images. The distinction between the foreground and background is very blurry, and the colors in the depth map are inconsistent with the objects' positions in the scene.\n\n### Conclusion\n- **Image 1** looks the most realistic because the RGB image is clear and detailed, and the depth map accurately represents the scene's depth.\n- **Image 2** is also realistic but slightly less so than Image 1 due to the slightly less clear depth map.\n- **Image 3** looks the least realistic because the depth map is very blurry and inconsistent with the objects' positions in the scene.\n\nTherefore, **Image 1** is the most realistic among the three."}

Here is a detailed description and explanation:\n\n1. **Maze**: The foreground of the image is dominated by a vast, intricate maze. The maze is composed of numerous interconnected paths and walls, creating a complex network of passages. The maze is rendered in a monochromatic color scheme, primarily in shades of gray, which gives it a minimalist and almost futuristic appearance.\n\n2. **Castle**: In the background, there is a large, detailed castle. The castle is built on a raised platform and features multiple towers, turrets, and battlements. The castle is also rendered in a monochromatic color scheme, matching the maze in its simplicity and abstraction.\n\n3. **Flags**: The castle is adorned with several flags, each flying on a flagpole. The flags are small and appear to be fluttering in the wind, adding a dynamic element to the otherwise static scene.\n\n4. **Light Source**: There is a bright light source near the top of the castle, which illuminates the surrounding area. The light is intense and creates a stark contrast with the rest of the image, drawing attention to the castle and its details.\n\n5. **Background**: The background of the image is minimalistic, with a flat, light gray sky and a distant, indistinct hill or mountain range. This simplicity helps to emphasize the intricate details of the maze and the castle.\n\n6. **Overall Composition**: The image is a digital or computer-generated artwork, characterized by its clean lines, geometric shapes, and lack of naturalistic details. The combination of the maze and the castle creates a sense of mystery and intrigue, as if the castle is a hidden treasure within the labyrinth.\n\nThe overall effect of the image is one of contrast and abstraction, with the maze and castle serving as the central elements that draw the viewer's attention. The use of monochromatic colors and the absence of natural elements contribute to a surreal and otherworldly atmosphere."}

The scene is set in front of a large, imposing castle with a domed structure at its center. The castle is detailed with multiple towers and windows, suggesting it is a significant and possibly important location within the game.\n\nIn the foreground, there are two characters. On the left, there is a character with a sword, standing in a defensive or ready position. This character is likely the player's avatar or a companion in the game. On the right, there is a smaller, more whimsical character with a cat-like appearance, holding a fireball or flame. This character might be a companion, pet, or ally in the game.\n\nThe background is dark, with a purple hue, which could indicate that the scene is taking place at night or in a dimly lit area. The overall atmosphere of the image is mysterious and somewhat ominous, with the large castle serving as a focal point.\n\nThe bottom part of the image has a purple background with a rectangular area that might be a status bar or a menu, indicating that the player is in a pause or selection screen. The character on the left is highlighted, suggesting that they are the active character at this moment.\n\nOverall, the image conveys a sense of adventure and exploration, with the player character preparing to enter or interact with the castle, possibly to uncover its secrets or face its challenges."}

Anarchism calls for the abolition of the state, which it holds to be unnecessary, undesirable, and harmful. As a historically left-wing movement, placed on the farthest left of the political spectrum, it is usually described alongside communalism and libertarian Marxism as the libertarian wing (libertarian socialism) of the socialist movement, and has a strong historical association with anti-capitalism and socialism. Humans lived in societies without formal hierarchies long before the establishment of formal states, realms, or empires. With the rise of organised hierarchical bodies, scepticism toward authority also rose. Although traces of anarchist thought are found throughout history, modern anarchism emerged from the Enlightenment. During the latter half of the 19th and the first decades of the 20th century, the anarchist movement flourished in most parts of the world and had a significant role in workers' struggles for emancipation. Various anarchist schools of thought formed during this period. Anarchists have taken part in several revolutions, most notably in the Paris Commune, the Russian Civil War and the Spanish Civil War, whose end marked the end of the classical era of anarchism. In the last decades of the 20th and into the 21st century, the anarchist movement has been resurgent once more. Anarchism employs a diversity of tactics in order to meet its ideal ends which can be broadly separated into revolutionary and evolutionary tactics; there is significant overlap between the two, which are merely descriptive. Revolutionary tactics aim to bring down authority and state, having taken a violent turn in the past, while evolutionary tactics aim to prefigure what an anarchist society would be like. Anarchist thought, criticism, and praxis have played a part in diverse areas of human society. Criticism of anarchism include claims that it is internally inconsistent, violent, or utopian. Etymology, terminology, and definition The etymological origin of anarchism is from the Ancient Greek anarkhia, meaning \"without a ruler\", composed of the prefix an- (\"without\") and the word arkhos (\"leader\" or \"ruler\"). The suffix -ism denotes the ideological current that favours anarchy.\n\nAnarchism appears in English from 1642 as anarchisme and anarchy from 1539; early English usages emphasised a sense of disorder. Various factions within the French Revolution labelled their opponents as anarchists, although few such accused shared many views with later anarchists. Many revolutionaries of the 19th century such as William Godwin (1756–1836) and Wilhelm Weitling (1808–1871) would contribute to the anarchist doctrines of the next generation but did not use anarchist or anarchism in describing themselves or their beliefs. The first political philosopher to call himself an anarchist () was Pierre-Joseph Proudhon (1809–1865), marking the formal birth of anarchism in the mid-19th century. Since the 1890s and beginning in France, libertarianism has often been used as a synonym for anarchism and its use as a synonym is still common outside the United States. Some usages of libertarianism refer to individualistic free-market philosophy only, and free-market anarchism in particular is termed libertarian anarchism. While the term libertarian has been largely synonymous with anarchism, its meaning has more recently diluted with wider adoption from ideologically disparate groups, including both the New Left and libertarian Marxists, who do not associate themselves with authoritarian socialists or a vanguard party, and extreme cultural liberals, who are primarily concerned with civil liberties. Additionally, some anarchists use libertarian socialist to avoid anarchism's negative connotations and emphasise its connections with socialism. Anarchism is broadly used to describe the anti-authoritarian wing of the socialist movement. Anarchism is contrasted to socialist forms which are state-oriented or from above. Scholars of anarchism generally highlight anarchism's socialist credentials and criticise attempts at creating dichotomies between the two. Some scholars describe anarchism as having many influences from liberalism, and being both liberals and socialists but more so, while most scholars reject anarcho-capitalism as a misunderstanding of anarchist principles. While opposition to the state is central to anarchist thought, defining anarchism is not an easy task for scholars, as there is a lot of discussion among scholars and anarchists on the matter, and various currents perceive anarchism slightly differently. Major definitional elements include the will for a non-coercive society, the rejection of the state apparatus, the belief that human nature allows humans to exist in or progress"}
