Here is a detailed summary:\n\n### Graph Axes:\n- **X-Axis (Horizontal):** Model Size (Bits), ranging from approximately 5E+10 to 1E+11 bits.\n- **Y-Axis (Vertical):** Wikitext-2 Perplexity (ctx 4096), ranging from 3 to 7.\n\n### Data Points and Lines:\n- **Blue Line (QuIP# 2 Bit):** Represents models quantized to 2 bits. The line shows a downward trend, indicating that as the model size decreases, the perplexity also decreases.\n- **Red Line (QuIP# 3 Bit):** Represents models quantized to 3 bits. This line also shows a downward trend, similar to the 2-bit models but with slightly different performance.\n- **Yellow Line (QuIP# 4 Bit):** Represents models quantized to 4 bits. The trend is similar to the 2-bit and 3-bit models.\n- **Gray Triangle (AQLM ~2 Bit):** Represents models quantized to approximately 2 bits. The trend is similar to the QuIP# models.\n- **Cyan Star (Theoretical Lossless (FP16) 4 Bit):** Represents theoretically lossless models quantized to 4 bits using FP16. This line shows a downward trend similar to the QuIP# models.\n- **Purple Diamond (QuIP 2 Bit):** Represents models quantized to 2 bits using a different method. This point is isolated and does not follow the same trend as the other data points.\n\n### Key Observations:\n- **QuIP# Models:** The QuIP# models (2-bit, 3-bit, and 4-bit) show a consistent trend of decreasing perplexity with decreasing model size.\n- **Comparison with Theoretical Lossless Models:** The QuIP# 3-bit models perform better in terms of scaling compared to theoretically lossless 4-bit models, which is noted as a previously unseen result.\n- **Overall Trend:** All models show a general trend of decreasing perplexity as the model size decreases, indicating improved performance with smaller model sizes.\n\n### Caption:\nThe caption at the bottom of the image states:\n\"Figure 1. QuIP# offers unprecedented quantization quality at extreme compression ratios. QuIP# 3-bit models also scale better than theoretically lossless 4-bit models, a previously unseen result.\"\n\nThis suggests that the QuIP# quantization method provides high-quality results even at extreme compression ratios, and the 3-bit models outperform the theoretically lossless 4-bit models in terms of scaling."}

Each incorrect guess results in a part of the hangman diagram being drawn. Typically, there are 6 incorrect guesses before the game is over.\n\n1. **Initial Setup**: The word \"HANGMAN\" has 8 letters.\n2. **Guessing Process**: Each letter in the word needs to be guessed correctly to solve the game. \n\nLet's break down the steps:\n- **Turn 1**: Guess a letter (e.g., 'H'). If it's correct, you have 1 letter revealed.\n- **Turn 2**: Guess another letter (e.g., 'A'). If it's correct, you have 2 letters revealed.\n- **Turn 3**: Guess another letter (e.g., 'N'). If it's correct, you have 3 letters revealed.\n- **Turn 4**: Guess another letter (e.g., 'G'). If it's correct, you have 4 letters revealed.\n- **Turn 5**: Guess another letter (e.g., 'M'). If it's correct, you have 5 letters revealed.\n- **Turn 6**: Guess another letter (e.g., 'A'). If it's correct, you have 6 letters revealed.\n- **Turn 7**: Guess another letter (e.g., 'N'). If it's correct, you have 7 letters revealed.\n- **Turn 8**: Guess another letter (e.g., 'M'). If it's correct, you have 8 letters revealed.\n\nIn this scenario, you would need 8 turns to guess all the letters correctly.\n\n**Which two letters might let you guess it more quickly?**\n- The letters 'H' and 'A' appear twice in the word \"HANGMAN.\" Guessing these letters first would reveal more letters in fewer turns, potentially speeding up the process of solving the word.\n\nBy guessing 'H' and 'A' first, you would have 4 letters revealed after just 2 turns, which is a significant head start.\nYou would need 8 turns to guess all the letters in the word \"HANGMAN.\" Guessing the letters 'H' and 'A' first would help you reveal more letters more quickly, potentially speeding up the process of solving the word."}

Whiskers was no ordinary cat; he had a distinctive appearance with a coat that was a mix of black, brown, and white, and striking blue eyes that seemed to hold a world of wisdom. His fur was soft and fluffy, and his whiskers were long and elegant, giving him a distinguished look.\n\nOne chilly autumn afternoon, Whiskers found himself in a peculiar situation. He had been exploring the house, as he often did, when he stumbled upon a large, red blanket draped over the back of a chair. The blanket was warm and inviting, and Whiskers, feeling a bit cold, decided to investigate further.\n\nAs he approached the blanket, he noticed that it was large enough to hide in. With a playful flick of his tail, Whiskers jumped onto the chair and burrowed himself under the blanket. The soft fabric enveloped him, and he felt a sense of comfort and security. He nestled deeper into the blanket, his blue eyes peeking out from the red folds.\n\nJust as Whiskers was getting comfortable, he heard a soft rustling sound. He paused, his ears perked up, and his eyes widened. The sound grew louder, and Whiskers realized that it was coming from the blanket itself. He looked around, trying to figure out what was happening, but all he could see was the red fabric surrounding him.\n\nSuddenly, the blanket began to move, and Whiskers felt a gentle tugging at his fur. He tried to move, but the blanket was too tight. He let out a small meow, a mix of confusion and concern. Just as he was about to struggle, he felt a soft, warm breath on his ear.\n\n\"Shh, little one,\" whispered a gentle voice. \"I'm not going to hurt you.\"\n\nWhiskers froze, his heart pounding in his chest. He had never heard a voice like this before. It was soft and soothing, and it seemed to come from everywhere and nowhere at the same time.\n\n\"Who are you?\" Whiskers asked, his voice barely a whisper.\n\nThe voice chuckled softly. \"I am the spirit of the blanket, Whiskers. I've been waiting for you.\"\n\nWhiskers tilted his head, his blue eyes filled with curiosity. \"Waiting for me? But why?\"\n\nThe spirit of the blanket sighed softly. \"Because, Whiskers, you are special. You have a unique spirit, just like mine. I've been watching you, and I see the way you explore the world, the way you find comfort in the smallest things. I wanted to meet"}

Here's a simplified guide to help you get started:\n\n### Materials Needed:\n- Watercolor paper\n- Watercolor paints (various shades of orange, yellow, black, white, etc.)\n- Brushes (various sizes and types, including round and flat brushes)\n- Palette for mixing colors\n- Water containers for rinsing brushes\n- Paper towels or a cloth for blotting brushes\n- Optional: Pencil and eraser for sketching\n\n### Steps:\n\n1. **Sketch the Tiger:**\n   - Lightly sketch the outline of the tiger on the watercolor paper using a pencil. You can find reference images online to help with proportions and details.\n\n2. **Prepare Your Colors:**\n   - Mix your colors on the palette. For a tiger, you'll need shades of orange, yellow, black, and white. You can create darker shades by mixing colors together.\n\n3. **Paint the Background:**\n   - Start by painting the background. For a natural setting, you might use shades of green for foliage or a gradient of blue for the sky.\n\n4. **Paint the Tiger's Body:**\n   - Begin with the base colors. Use a large brush to apply the main shades of orange and yellow to the tiger's body.\n   - While the paint is still wet, use a clean, damp brush to gently blend the colors together, creating a smooth transition.\n\n5. **Add Stripes:**\n   - Use a smaller brush to add the tiger's distinctive black stripes. Start with the main stripes and then fill in the smaller ones.\n   - Be careful not to overwork the paint, as watercolors can become muddy if they are over-blended.\n\n6. **Detail the Face:**\n   - Paint the tiger's face, focusing on the eyes, nose, and mouth. Use darker shades of orange and black to create depth and definition.\n   - Add highlights to the eyes using white or a light yellow to give them a glowing effect.\n\n7. **Add Water Effects:**\n   - If you want to include water splashes, as seen in the image, use a technique called \"splattering.\" Load a brush with water and tap it gently over the area where you want the splashes. Alternatively, you can use a toothbrush to flick water onto the paper.\n\n8. **Final Touches:**\n   - Allow the painting to dry completely.\n   - Once dry, you can go back and add any final details or touch-ups. Use a fine brush to add small highlights or correct any mistakes.\n\n9. **Frame Your Artwork:**\n   - Once you're satisfied with your painting, you can frame it or display it as you like.\n\n### Tips:\n- Work from light to dark. Watercolors are more forgiving when you build up layers from lighter to darker shades.\n- Keep your brushes clean and your water containers separate to avoid muddying your colors.\n- Practice blending and layering techniques to achieve the desired effect.\n\nEnjoy the creative process and have fun painting your watercolor tiger!"}

The study reports on the first population of common long-tailed macaques (Macaca fascicularis fascicularis) that began using stone tools to open rock oysters (Saccostrea forskalii) on Koh Ped (KPE), an island in the Gulf of Thailand. This behavior was observed several times over the past 10 years, but no stone-tool use was noted until the COVID-19 pandemic in July 2022.

This essay explores the notion of customer-based brand equity, highlighting its importance, components, and implications for businesses.\n\n#### Understanding Customer-Based Brand Equity\n\nCustomer-based brand equity refers to the value that a brand holds in the minds of its customers. This value is derived from the perceptions, attitudes, and experiences that customers have with the brand. Unlike traditional brand equity, which often focuses on financial metrics and market share, customer-based brand equity is centered on the emotional and psychological connections that customers form with a brand.\n\n#### Key Components of Customer-Based Brand Equity\n\n1. **Brand Awareness**: This is the first and most fundamental component of customer-based brand equity. Brand awareness refers to the extent to which customers are familiar with a brand and can recall it under various circumstances. High brand awareness is crucial because it sets the stage for further interactions and relationships with the brand.\n\n2. **Brand Associations**: These are the mental connections that customers make with a brand. Associations can be positive or negative and can include attributes, benefits, or experiences related to the brand. Strong, positive brand associations enhance brand equity by making the brand more appealing and distinctive.\n\n3. **Brand Loyalty**: Loyal customers are those who consistently choose a particular brand over others, even when alternative options are available. Brand loyalty is a critical component of customer-based brand equity because it leads to repeat purchases and long-term customer relationships.\n\n4. **Perceived Quality**: The perceived quality of a brand is how customers judge its products or services in terms of their excellence and superiority. A brand with a strong reputation for quality can command higher prices and attract more customers.\n\n#### Implications for Businesses\n\n1. **Enhanced Customer Engagement**: By focusing on customer-based brand equity, businesses can create more meaningful and engaging experiences for their customers. This can be achieved through personalized marketing, customer service, and innovative product offerings.\n\n2. **Competitive Advantage**: Brands that successfully build strong customer-based brand equity gain a competitive edge. Customers are more likely to choose these brands over competitors, even if the competitors offer similar products at lower prices.\n\n3. **Long-Term Growth**: Customer-based brand equity fosters long-term growth by cultivating loyal customers who become brand advocates. These advocates can help attract new customers and expand the brand's reach through positive word-of-mouth and social media influence.\n\n4. **Risk Mitigation**: Brands with strong customer-based brand equity are better equipped to handle market fluctuations and crises. During challenging times, loyal customers are more likely to remain faithful to the brand, reducing the impact of external shocks.\n\n#### Conclusion\n\nCustomer-based brand equity is a powerful concept that underscores the importance of customer perceptions and experiences in building brand value. By focusing on brand awareness, associations, loyalty, and perceived quality, businesses can create strong, enduring connections with their customers. This not only enhances customer engagement and competitive advantage but also drives long-term growth and risk mitigation. In today's fast-paced and dynamic market, understanding and leveraging customer-based brand equity is essential for businesses seeking to thrive and sustain their success."}

Additionally, increasing the font size can make the text more legible, especially for the business name and contact information.\n\n3. **Alignment**: Ensure that the text is properly aligned. Center alignment can make the card look more balanced, but left alignment is also a common choice for business cards.\n\n4. **Color Scheme**: The blue background with black text is a good choice, but consider adding a subtle pattern or texture to the background to make it more visually appealing without compromising readability.\n\n5. **Contact Information**: Grouping the contact information together can make it easier to find. For example, the phone number and address can be placed in a separate section or enclosed in a box.\n\n6. **Logo or Branding**: Adding a small logo or branding element can make the business card more memorable.

The plot uses different colors to differentiate countries, with blue representing higher electricity consumption and orange representing lower consumption.\n\nKey observations from the plot include:\n\n1. **High Electricity Consumption and High Income**: Countries like Norway, the United States, and Saudi Arabia are positioned in the upper-right quadrant, indicating high levels of both electricity consumption and GDP per capita.\n\n2. **High Electricity Consumption and Low Income**: Countries such as India and Indonesia are located in the upper-left quadrant, showing high electricity consumption but lower GDP per capita.\n\n3. **Low Electricity Consumption and Low Income**: Countries like Burundi, Somalia, and Sierra Leone are in the lower-left quadrant, indicating both low electricity consumption and low GDP per capita.\n\n4. **Low Electricity Consumption and High Income**: There are no countries in the lower-right quadrant, which would indicate low electricity consumption but high GDP per capita.\n\nThe red circle highlights the absence of countries in the lower-right quadrant. This absence suggests that there is no known instance of a country with a high GDP per capita but low electricity consumption per capita. This implies a strong correlation between higher income levels and higher electricity consumption.\n\n### Important Conclusion:\nThe red circle emphasizes that high-income countries tend to have high electricity consumption per capita. This correlation underscores the dependency of economic development on energy consumption. It suggests that increased economic activity and higher standards of living are typically associated with greater electricity usage. Conversely, countries with lower electricity consumption are generally those with lower GDP per capita, indicating a potential barrier to economic growth without increased energy access and usage."}

Let's address each question one by one.\n\n### Question 1: If some features have strong colinearity does it make model performance worse?\n\n**Answer:**\nYes, strong colinearity among features can negatively impact model performance. Colinearity occurs when two or more features are highly correlated, meaning they provide similar information. This can lead to several issues:\n\n1. **Multicollinearity**: This can cause the parameter estimates of the model to become unstable and sensitive to small changes in the data. The coefficients may become very large or very small, making the model difficult to interpret.\n\n2. **Overfitting**: Models may overfit the training data, performing well on the training set but poorly on unseen data.\n\n3. **Reduced Predictive Power**: The model may lose its ability to generalize well to new data, leading to poorer performance.\n\nTo mitigate these issues, techniques such as Principal Component Analysis (PCA) or removing one of the highly correlated features can be used.\n\n### Question 2: What does the decision boundary of logistic regression look like?\n\n**Answer:**\nThe decision boundary of logistic regression is a hyperplane that separates the classes in the feature space. For a binary classification problem, this hyperplane is defined by the equation:\n\n\\[ \\mathbf{w} \\cdot \\mathbf{x} + b = 0 \\]\n\nwhere:\n- \\(\\mathbf{w}\\) is the weight vector (a vector of coefficients for each feature),\n- \\(\\mathbf{x}\\) is the input feature vector,\n- \\(b\\) is the bias term.\n\nThe logistic regression model uses the logistic (sigmoid) function to map the linear combination \\(\\mathbf{w} \\cdot \\mathbf{x} + b\\) to a probability value between 0 and 1, which represents the likelihood of the input belonging to one of the classes.\n\nThe decision boundary is essentially the point where the probability of belonging to either class is 0.5. This boundary is a straight line in 2D, a plane in 3D, and a hyperplane in higher dimensions.\n\nIn summary, the decision boundary of logistic regression is a linear separator that divides the feature space into regions corresponding to different classes based on the logistic function."}

The image you provided is a schematic diagram of a proposed power detector circuit. Let's break down its composition and working principle step-by-step.\n\n### Circuit Composition\n\n1. **Input Section:**\n   - The circuit starts with an RF input signal (`RF_in`) which is connected to a capacitor. This capacitor acts as a blocking capacitor to prevent DC from flowing into the circuit while allowing the AC signal to pass through.\n\n2. **Power Detector Unit:**\n   - The RF input signal is fed into a power detector unit which consists of two main transistors (`M1` and `M2`).\n   - Each transistor is biased with a bias voltage (`V_bias`). The bias voltages are provided to ensure the transistors operate in their active regions.\n   - The transistors are configured in a differential pair setup, which is common in RF circuits for detecting the amplitude of the input signal.\n\n3. **Operational Amplifier (Op-amp):**\n   - The output of the power detector unit is connected to an operational amplifier (Op-amp). The Op-amp amplifies the differential signal from the transistors.\n   - The Op-amp is configured to take the difference between the two inputs (`V+` and `V-`) and amplify it.\n\n4. **Exponential Current Generator:**\n   - The amplified signal from the Op-amp is fed into an exponential current generator. This part of the circuit consists of transistors (`M13`, `M14`, and `M15`).\n   - The exponential current generator converts the amplified voltage signal into an exponential current, which is useful for logarithmic detection or other non-linear operations.\n\n5. **Level Shifter:**\n   - The output of the exponential current generator is fed into a level shifter. The level shifter adjusts the output voltage level to a desired range.\n   - The level shifter ensures that the final output voltage (`V_out`) is within the acceptable range for the intended application.\n\n### Working Principle\n\n1. **Signal Detection:**\n   - The RF input signal is detected by the differential pair of transistors (`M1` and `M2`). The amplitude of the RF signal is converted into a voltage signal at the drains of these transistors.\n\n2. **Amplification:**\n   - The voltage signal from the differential pair is fed into the Op-amp. The Op-amp amplifies the signal to increase its strength and improve the signal-to-noise ratio.\n\n3. **Exponential Conversion:**\n   - The amplified voltage signal is then converted into an exponential current by the exponential current generator. This step is crucial for applications that require logarithmic detection or other non-linear operations.\n\n4. **Level Shifting:**\n   - Finally, the exponential current is converted into a suitable output voltage by the level shifter. The level shifter ensures that the output voltage is within the desired range for the application.\n\n### Summary\n\nThe proposed power detector circuit detects the amplitude of an RF input signal, amplifies it, converts it into an exponential current, and then adjusts the output voltage to a suitable level. This circuit is useful in applications requiring precise detection and measurement of RF signal amplitudes."}

Look for unnatural shadows, inconsistent lighting, or areas where the lighting doesn't seem to follow real-world physics.\n\n3. **Texture Quality**: Real photographs typically have more natural textures, whereas rendered images might have smoother or less detailed textures.\n\n4. **Color Consistency**: Check for color consistency. Real images often have more natural variations in color and lighting, while rendered images might have more uniform or unnatural colors.\n\n5. **Artifacts**: Look for any visible seams, repeating patterns, or other artifacts that indicate the image might be computer-generated.\n\nGiven these factors, let's analyze the image:\n\n- **Sharpness and Clarity**: The image appears to be quite sharp and clear, with no obvious areas of blurriness.\n- **Lighting and Shadows**: The lighting and shadows seem natural and consistent with what you would expect in a real room.\n- **Texture Quality**: The textures on the table, chairs, and floor appear natural and detailed.\n- **Color Consistency**: The colors are consistent and natural, without any unnatural uniformity.\n- **Artifacts**: There are no visible seams, repeating patterns, or other artifacts that indicate the image is computer-generated.\n\nBased on this analysis, the image appears to be a real photograph rather than a rendered image.\n\n**Photorealism Score**: 5"}

Are they increasing, decreasing, or fluctuating around a central value?\n\n   From the image, the data points start high on the left and gradually decrease as they move to the right. This suggests a downward trend.\n\n2. **Determine the shape of the trend**: Is the trend linear, exponential, logarithmic, quadratic, or some other shape?\n\n   - **Linear**: A straight line would fit if the data points form a straight line.\n   - **Exponential/Logarithmic**: These would fit if the data points curve more steeply as they move away from the origin.\n   - **Quadratic**: A parabolic shape would fit if the data points form a U-shape.\n   - **Polynomial**: Higher-degree polynomials could fit more complex shapes.\n\n   The data points in the image do not form a straight line but rather a curve that gradually decreases. This suggests a non-linear relationship.\n\n3. **Check for symmetry**: Is the curve symmetric around a central point?\n\n   The data points do not appear to be symmetric around a central point, suggesting a non-symmetric curve.\n\n4. **Consider the context**: What is the nature of the data? Is it growth, decay, or some other process?\n\n   Given the context of the data points decreasing over time, a common fit for such data is an exponential decay.\n\n5. **Visual inspection**: Compare the data points to typical curve shapes.\n\n   The data points resemble an exponential decay curve, where the rate of decrease slows down over time.\n\nBased on the analysis, the best type of curve fit for this data is an **exponential decay** curve. This type of curve fit is commonly used to model processes where a quantity decreases over time at a rate that depends on its current value."}

The discounts and their corresponding points are well-organized and easy to read.\n\n2. **Match between system and the real world:**\n   - The terminology used (e.g., \"Total points,\" \"Discounts\") is clear and familiar to users.\n   - The discounts and points are straightforward and easy to understand.\n\n3. **User control and freedom:**\n   - Users can easily claim discounts by tapping on the \"Claim\" button.\n   - There is no apparent way for users to navigate back to previous screens directly from this screen.\n\n4. **Consistency and standards:**\n   - The design and layout are consistent with typical mobile app design standards.\n   - The use of standard icons and buttons (e.g., claim button) is appropriate.\n\n5. **Error prevention:**\n   - There are no evident error messages or warnings.\n   - The system does not prevent users from claiming discounts they do not have enough points for.\n\n6. **Recognition rather than recall:**\n   - Users do not need to remember much information to navigate the screen.\n   - All necessary information is visible on the screen.\n\n7. **Flexibility and efficiency of use:**\n   - Power users might find it efficient to claim discounts quickly.\n   - The layout is simple and straightforward, making it easy for users to find what they need.\n\n8. **Aesthetics and minimalist design:**\n   -

The search bar allows users to filter the list easily.\n\n2. **Match between system and the real world:**\n   - The terminology used for ingredients and their details is clear.\n   - The system provides a straightforward way to search and filter the list.\n\n3. **User control and freedom:**\n   - Users can easily search for specific ingredients.\n   - There is no apparent way for users to navigate back to previous screens directly from this screen.\n\n4. **Consistency and standards:**\n   - The design and layout are consistent with typical mobile app design standards.\n   - The use of standard icons and buttons (e.g., search bar) is appropriate.\n\n5. **Error prevention:**\n   - There are no evident error messages or warnings.\n   - The system does not prevent users from searching for non-existent items.\n\n6. **Recognition rather than recall:**\n   - Users do not need to remember much information to navigate the screen.\n   - All necessary information is visible on the screen.\n\n7. **Flexibility and efficiency of use:**\n   - Power users might find it efficient to quickly search for specific ingredients.\n   -

It notes that the model often goes through a \"plateau\" phase where it only predicts grey blur patches, leading to stagnation in training loss. The text suggests that adding a text prefix at the beginning of the input sequence can help reduce the chance of stagnation and start decreasing the loss earlier. The intuition behind this is that the text prefix provides the model with an easy and stable target to learn. Additionally, it is observed that a longer text prefix has a more significant effect. In the experiments, all models use a text prefix of \"Beginning of the sequence.\" The paragraph concludes by mentioning that Appendix G provides examples of rendered screenshots with the text prefix."}

Anarchism is a political philosophy and movement that is skeptical of authority and rejects all involuntary, coercive forms of hierarchy. Anarchism calls for the abolition of the state, which it holds to be unnecessary, undesirable, and harmful. As a historically left-wing movement, placed on the farthest left of the political spectrum, it is usually described alongside communnalism and Libertarian Marxism as the libertarian wing (libertarian socialism) of the socialism movement, and has a strong historical association with anti-capitalism and socialism. Humans lived in societies without formal hierarchies long before the establishment of formal states, realms, or empires. With the rise of organised hierarchical bodies, scepticism toward authority also rose. Although traces of anarchist thought are found throughout history, modern anarchism emerged from the Enlightenment. During the latter half of the 19th and the first decades of the 20th century, the anarchist movement flourished in most parts of the world and had a significant role in workers' struggles for emancipation. Various anarchist schools of thought formed during this period. Anarchists have taken part in several revolutions, most notably in the Paris Commune, the Russian Civil War and the Spanish Civil War, whose end marked the end of the classical era of anarchism. In the last decades of the 20th and into the 21st century, the anarchist movement has been resurgent once more. Anarchism employs a diversity of tactics in order to meet its ideal ends which can be broadly separated into revolutionary and evolutionary tactics; there is significant overlap between the two, which are merely descriptive. Revolutionary tactics aim to bring down authority and state, having taken a violent turn in the past, while evolutionary tactics aim to prefigure what an anarchist society would be like. Anarchist thought, criticism, and praxis have played a part in diverse areas of human society. Criticism of anarchism include claims that it is internally inconsistent, violent, or utopian. Etymology, terminology, and definition The etymological origin of anarchism is from the Ancient Greek anarchia, meaning \"without a ruler\", composed of the prefix an- (\"without\") and the word arkhos (\"leader\" or \"ruler\"). The suffix -ism denotes the ideological current that favours anarchy.\n\nAnarchism appears in English from 1642 as anarchisme and anarchy from 1539; early English usages emphasised a sense of disorder. Various factions within the French Revolution labelled their opponents as anarchists, although few such accused shared many views with later anarchists. Many revolutionaries of the 18th century such as William Godwin (1756–1836) and Wilhelm Weitling (1808–1871) would contribute to the anarchist doctrines of the next generation but did not use anarchist or anarchism in describing themselves or their beliefs. The first political philosopher to call himself an anarchist was Pierre-Joseph Proudhon (1809–1865), marking the formal birth of anarchism in the mid-19th century. Since the 1890s and beginning in France, libertarianism has often been used as a synonym for anarchism and its use as a synonym is still common outside the United States. Some usages of libertarianism refer to individualistic free-market philosophy only, and free-market anarchism in particular is termed libertarian anarchism. While the term libertarian has been largely synonymous with anarchism, its meaning has more recently diluted with wider adoption from ideologically disparate groups, including both the New Left and libertarian Marxists, who do not associate themselves with authoritarian socialists or a vanguard party, and extreme cultural liberals, who are primarily concerned with civil liberties. Additionally, some anarchists use libertarian socialism to avoid anarchism's negative connotations and emphasise its connections with socialism. Anarchism is broadly used to describe the anti-authoritarian wing of the socialist movement. Anarchism is contrasted to socialist forms which are state-oriented or from above. Scholars of anarchism generally highlight anarchism's socialist credentials and criticise attempts at creating dichotomies between the two. Some scholars describe anarchism as having many influences from liberalism, and being both liberals and socialists but more so, while most scholars reject anarcho-capitalism as a misunderstanding of anarchist principles. While opposition to the state is central to anarchist thought, defining anarchism is not an easy task for scholars, as there is a lot of discussion among scholars and anarchists on the matter, and various currents perceive anarchism slightly differently. Major definitional elements include the will for a non-coercive society, the rejection of the state apparatus, the belief that human nature allows humans to exist in or progress"}
